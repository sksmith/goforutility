# Go For Utility

* Good for devs to have many tools in their toolbelt
  * Shell-scripting
  * Regular expressions
  * Weird formulas and scripts in Excel
* Lately been picking up a new tool for quick, useful programs - Go
  * Attracted to it because
    * Reminded me of C
      * Syntax similar
      * Small, basic library
    * "Batteries included" library
      * Build CLIs, and Web Services
* Reached for language enough now, that I feel good recommending it
  * I've written
    * A few restful web services
    * A CLI wrapper for Kafka's unweidly CLI
    * Implementations of popular algorithms for self-education
* Most recently, wrote
  * A CLI tool for quickly generating a pairing schedule in Wiki Markup
  * A one off tool for reprocessing a batch of orders
* Create "Hello, Go!"
  * All I need is a main project, and func
  * If I want to add dependencies... go mod init
